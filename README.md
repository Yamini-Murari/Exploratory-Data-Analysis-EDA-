# Exploratory-Data-Analysis (EDA)

NAME : MURARI YAMINI

OBJECTIVE : Understand data using statistics and visualizations

TOOLS USED : pandas for dataset loading,matplotlib for visualization(histograms,boxplots),seaborn for correlation heatmap

STEPS PERFORMED :

                  1. used df.describe() to view mean,median,standard deviation and quartiles
                  2.plotted histograms and boxplots for features like Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch to understand their distributions
                  3.used correlation matrix for feature relationships
                  4.boxplots helped to detect and visualize outliers in the features

OUTPUT : when plotting survival rates by the Embarked port,we found:

1.passengers who embarked at Cherbourg(C) had the highest survival rate

2.southampton(S) had the lowest survival rate

3.Queenstown(Q) had a moderate survival rate
